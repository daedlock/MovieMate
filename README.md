**Movie**Mate is built with
* React
* Redux
* Webpack
* Electron
* Lots of love
  
**Features:**  
* Sync it with your movie library (folders, external hdd..etc) 
* Get movies presented as covers with scraped ratings
* Get movie information from imdb, rottentomatoes 
* Get movie reviews and critiques from imdb 
* Watch the trailer 
* Sort movies by genre, rating, year
* Get movie subtitles from opensubtitles, subscene..etc   
 Â  
   
**How it Works**  
After adding your media sources (files and folders) MovieMate does the following
* Extract movie title from file name
* Scrapes movie information from imdb, rottentomatoes
* Caches the scraped movies in local database


All the above happens in a harmonic unique experience similar to that of xbmc tv app with a much simpler model. The only input required to get started is a list of file names. The app parses the file names and then scrapes all the relevant data for all the movies in the library.

Welcoming feedback and ideas!
